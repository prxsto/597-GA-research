  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of all significant research applying computational optimisation to sustainable building design problems. A summary of common heuristic optimisation algorithms is given, covering direct search, evolutionary methods and other bio-inspired algorithms. The main summary table covers 74 works that focus on the application of these methods to different fields of sustainable building design. Key fields are reviewed in detail: envelope design, including constructions and form; configuration and control of building systems; renewable energy generation; and holistic optimisations of several areas simultaneously, with particular focus on residential and retrofit. Improvements to the way optimisation is applied are also covered, including platforms and frameworks, algorithmic comparisons and developments, use of meta-models and incorporation of uncertainty. Trends, including the rise of multi-objective optimisation, are analysed graphically. Likely future developments are discussed.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a method to optimize the equivalent thermophysical properties of the external walls (thermal conductivity kwall and volumetric specific heat (ρc)wall) of a dwelling in order to improve its thermal efficiency. Classical optimization involves several dynamic yearly thermal simulations, which are commonly quite time consuming. To reduce the computational requirements, we have adopted a methodology that couples an artificial neural network and the genetic algorithm NSGA-II. This optimization technique has been applied to a dwelling for two French climates, Nancy (continental) and Nice (Mediterranean). We have chosen to characterize the energy performance of the dwelling with two criteria, which are the optimization targets: the annual energy consumption QTOT and the summer comfort degree Isum. First, using a design of experiments, we have quantified and analyzed the impact of the variables kwall and (ρc)wall on the objectives QTOT and Isum, depending on the climate. Then, the optimal Pareto fronts obtained from the optimization are presented and analyzed. The optimal solutions are compared to those from mono-objective optimization by using an aggregative method and a constraint problem in GenOpt. The comparison clearly shows the importance of performing multi-objective optimization.},

  abstract = {Genetic Algorithm (GA) is widely adopted in optimization and the improvement of its optimization performance is attracting many researchers’ attentions. In solving practical problems in the process of architectural design, the ways of converting design problems into mathematical models that can be addressed by GA are of great significance in achieving final optimal results. However, no such rule that can be applied to such conversion has been developed so far. In general, problems which can be addressed by GA can be divided into combinatorial problems and numerical problems. In this paper, by means of attempting to disintegrate a complicated architectural problem into combinatorial and numerical problems, the author discusses feasibility and practicality of solving these two types of problems simultaneously utilizing GA and discloses both advantages and disadvantages of GA by comparing with other algorithms.},

  abstract = {The first part of this paper proposed a hybrid evolutionary technique which helps architects to generate sets of floor plans in the early design stage. The algorithm is an enhanced Evolutionary Strategy (ES) with a Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC) technique. In this second part, the validity and performance of the technique is examined. Four tests are conducted. Three validation tests are used to determine the ability of the algorithm to replicate a floor plan made by an architect; the ability to produce a set of different floor plan designs by comparing the results with a well-known enumerated floor plan solution; its capability to work with less constrained problems, and to control the variation in the floor plan form with different compactness evaluators’ weights. The last test determines the evolving behavior, the breakdown of the evaluators’ performance for the objective function, and the robustness of the algorithm. The methodologies used in the tests and the problem specifications are presented. Results and observations on the evaluators’ weights and their importance and the limitations of the technique are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the conclusion to this part of the paper is made.},
